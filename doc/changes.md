# Change Log # {#changes}

  - Added a `timeLimit` parameter to all potentially time intensive functions.
  - Bugfix for the `timeLimit` parameter.
  - Added \ref CMRdecIsSeriesParallelReduction and \ref CMRdecIsUnknown to interface for regular matroid decompositions.

## Version 1.3 ##

  - Redesigned as [Combinatorial Matrix Recognition](\ref index) Library.
  - Added recognition of [(co)graphic](\ref graphic) and [(co)network](\ref network) matrices.
  - Added recognition of [series-parallel matrices](\ref series-parallel).
  - Moved all C++ code to internal implementation. The library interface is only in C.
  - Added generators for network, graphic and random matrices.

# TUtest Library #

This library is the successor of the **TUtest** library, originally developed by Matthias Walter and Klaus Truemper for the recognition of [totally unimodular matrices](\ref tu).
The new name and additional functionality are available since version 1.3.
