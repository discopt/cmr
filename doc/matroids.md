# Representation of Matroids and their Decomposition # {#matroids}

The matroid **represented** by a matrix \f$ M \in \mathbb{F}^{m \times n} \f$ has \f$ m + n \f$ elements that correspond to the columns of \f$ [ \mathbb{I} \mid M ] \f$.
A subset of these columns is independent if and only if it is linearly independent over the field \f$ \mathbb{F} \f$.

## Decomposition of matroids {#matroid_decomposition}

In CMR, the matroid represented by a matrix can be decomposed, which is essential for testing for [total unimodularity](\ref tu) and [regularity](\ref regular).
The internal representation is a decomposition tree whose nodes are references to \ref CMR_MATROID_DEC.

Each such decomposition node belongs to a **matrix**, either of the ternary field \f$ \mathbb{F} = \mathbb{F}_3 \f$ or over the binary field \f$ \mathbb{F} = \mathbb{F}_2 \f$.
This is indicated by \ref CMRmatroiddecIsTernary.
While each node has an explicit matrix (see \ref CMRmatroiddecGetMatrix), its transpose need not be stored explicitly (see \ref CMRmatroiddecHasTranspose and \ref CMRmatroiddecGetTranspose).
If the matroid is [regular](\ref regular) then the support matrix of such a ternary matrix is then also a binary representation matrix.

A decomposition node may have **children**, which are (references to) other decomposition nodes.
Their number can be queried via \ref CMRmatroiddecNumChildren and each child via \ref CMRmatroiddecChild.

Moreover, it has (exactly) one of the following **types**:

 - An [unknown](\ref CMR_MATROID_DEC_TYPE_UNKNOWN) node indicates that the matroid decomposition of the corresponding matrix was not carried out, yet.
   It is considered a leaf node.
