# Combinatorial Matrix Recognition Library # {#index}

This C/C++ library contains efficient implementations of various algorithm for recognizing combinatorial matrices.
The following matrix classes can be recognized:

  - \ref tu
  - \ref network
  - \ref ctu
  - \ref k-modular

Moreover, base representation matrices for the following matroid classes can be recognized:

  - \ref regular
  - \ref graphic
  - \ref series-parallel

The following additional functionality is also part of the library:

  - \ref conversions
  - \ref camion

The following matrix/matroid classes are **planned**:

  - \ref balanced
  - \ref perfect
  - \ref consecutive-ones
  - \ref max-flow-min-cut

# Usage #

The functionality can be used via command-line tools or via its C/C++ interface.
There is one executable per matrix/matroid class.
Its documentation and that of the interface can be found on the respective pages.
The executables accept several \ref file-formats.
