# Camion's Signing Algorithm # {#camion}

A key tool for the recognition of [network matrices](\ref network), [totally unimodular matrices](\ref tu) and [balanceable matrices](\ref balanced) is Camion's signing algorithm.
Its input is a binary matrix \f$ M \in \{0,1\}^{m \times n} \f$ and it computes a ternary matrix \f$ M' \in \{-1,0,+1\}^{m \times n} \f$ with the same support, i.e., the same nonzero entries.
The output matrix \f$ M' \f$ is guaranteed to be [balanced](\ref balanced) if (and only if) \f$ M \f$ was [balanceable](\ref balanced).
This means that for every square submatrix of \f$ M' \f$ with two nonzero entries per row and per column the the sum of all entries is divisible by 4.
The algorithm always outputs a **Camion-signed matrix**, regardless of whether the input matrix was balanceable.
In particular, it does not recognize whether it deals with a balanceable matrix or not.

If \f$ M \f$ is balanceable, then \f$ M' \f$ is unique up to scaling rows/columns with \f$ -1 \f$.


## Checking for being Camion-signed ##

The command

    cmr-camion IN-MAT [OPTION]...

determines whether the matrix given in file `IN-MAT` is Camion-signed.

**Options:**
  - `-i FORMAT`   Format of file `IN-MAT`, among `dense` for \ref dense-matrix and `sparse` for \ref sparse-matrix; default: dense.
  - `-N NON-SUB`  Write a minimal non-Camion submatrix to file `NON-SUB`; default: skip computation.
  - `-s`          Print statistics about the computation to stderr.

If `IN-MAT` is `-` then the matrix is read from stdin.
If `NON-SUB` is `-` then the submatrix is written to stdout.

### Algorithm ###

The implemented recognition algorithm is based on Section 18 of [A decomposition theory for matroids. V. Testing of matrix total unimodularity](https://doi.org/10.1016/0095-8956(90)90030-4) by Klaus Truemper (Journal of Combinatorial Theory, Series B, 1990).
For a matrix \f$ M \in \{-1,0,1\}^{m \times n} \f$ it runs in \f$ \mathcal{O}( \min(m^2 \cdot n, m \cdot n^2) ) \f$ time.

### C Interface ###

The corresponding function in the library is

  - CMRcamionTestSigns() tests a matrix for being Camion-signed.

and is defined in \ref camion.h.

  
## Camion-signing a Matrix ##

The command

    cmr-camion IN-MAT -S OUT-MAT [OPTION]...

modifies the signs of the matrix given in file `IN-MAT` such that it is Camion-signed and writes the resulting new matrix to file `OUT-MAT`.

**Options:**
  - `-i FORMAT`   Format of file `IN-MAT`, among `dense` for \ref dense-matrix and `sparse` for \ref sparse-matrix; default: dense.
  - `-o FORMAT`   Format of file `OUT-MAT`, among `dense` for \ref dense-matrix and `sparse` for \ref sparse-matrix; default: same as format of `IN-MAT`.
  - `-s`          Print statistics about the computation to stderr.

If `IN-MAT` is `-` then the matrix is read from stdin.
If `OUT-MAT` is `-` then the matrix is written to stdout.
