1. Create a build directory:

mkdir build

2. Go to the build directory:

cd build/

3. Configure the build:

cmake ..

4. Compile:

make

5. Use one of executables:

./cmr-camion          # Camion's signing algorithm
./cmr-convert-matrix  # Matrix conversion (dense <-> sparse, transpose, support, sign)
./cmr-ctu             # Complementary totally unimodular matrices
./cmr-graphic         # Graphic binary matroids
./cmr-network         # Network matrices
./cmr-tu              # Totally unimodular matrices
./cmr-k-modular       # (Strongly) unimodular and k-modular matrices
./cmr-series-parallel # Series-parallel matrices

6. Optionally, you can also install the executables.

make install
